I aim to bring people a little more happiness, whether that be with music, artwork, or useful tools that you guys can use in your projects.

With that in mind, please take a look around and see what you can ~steal~ _utilise._
Who knows? These projects might even give you a bit of inspiration for yourself!

## Projects

Here is some of my projects that I've been working on: 

### [⚛️ Elements](https://github.com/Magnogen/Elements)

A library of useful Javascript functions and variables that I use for most of my projects.

### [🌈 Gr**ai**dients](https://magnogen.net/Graidients)

Generate gradients and patterns using Neural Networks.

### [📺 YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCosxKKKPJk4aZlwF_EFe2pw)

There's a bunch of stuff on here, from music videos, to fractals to video games.

### [✏️ Gentle](https://github.com/Magnogen/Gentle)

A C-like programming language who's sole purpose is to create Generative Art.

I have quite a few other projects here and there.
