# Hey! I'm Mag 👋

😔 I have so many projects on the go, it's hard to keep count.

🔍 You can find most of them here, on my GitHub account!

I aim to bring people a little more happiness, whether that be with music, or useful tools that you guys can use in your projects - so please do take a look around and see what you can <s>steal</s> <i>utilise.</i> Who knows? I might even give you a bit of inspiration yourself!

Here is some of the thingies that I've been working on:

## Projects
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

### 🎵 Music & YouTube

Most of my current content lol. I plan on doing proper YouTube videos in the future - documenting my projects, and even some Minecraft-related content too!

### 🔤 Avoweliu

An Esoteric Programming Language who's only commands are the vowels in the alphabet: A, E, I, O & U (and Y, but we don't talk about her)

<a href="https://ide.magnogen.net/avoweliu/">Playground</a> (Incomplete: Syntax Highlighting is pretty much it so far)

### 🧪 HeLiiLii

Another Esoteric Programming Language that <i>looks</i> like Mathematics, but is actually closer to Literature and Chemistry...
