I aim to bring people a little more happiness, whether that be with music, artwork, or useful tools that you guys can use in your projects.
With that in mind, please take a look around and see what you can ~steal~ _utilise._
Who knows? These projects might even give you a bit of inspiration for yourself!

## Projects

Here is some of my projects that I've been working on: 

### [⚛️ Elements](https://github.com/Magnogen/Elements)

A library of useful Javascript functions and variables that I use for most of my projects. Inspired by [Habitat](https://github.com/l2wilson94/Habitat).  

### [🌐 Weber](https://github.com/Magnogen/Weber)

A way to make websites using languages like Markdown and JSON, compiles to weblangs. 

### [📺 YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCosxKKKPJk4aZlwF_EFe2pw)

There's a bunch of stuff on here, from music videos, to fractals to video games.

### [✏️ Gentle](https://github.com/Magnogen/Gentle)

A C-like programming language who's sole purpose is to create Generative Art.

### [⚛ Carbogen](https://github.com/Magnogen/Carbogen)

A Programming Language that makes use of bubbles (scopes) to do a bunch of interesting things.

I have quite a few other projects here and there.
