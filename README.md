# Hey! I'm Mag 👋

😔 I have so many projects on the go, it's hard to keep count.

🔍 You can find most of them here, on my GitHub account!

I aim to bring people a little more happiness, whether that be with music, or useful tools that you guys can use in your projects - so please do take a look around and see what you can <s>steal</s> <i>utilise.</i> Who knows? I might even give you a bit of inspiration yourself!

Here is some of the thingies that I've been working on:

## Programming Languages

### Avoweliu

An Esoteric Programming Language who's only commands are the vowels in the alphabet: A, E, I, O & U (and Y, but we don't talk about her)

### HeLiiLii

Another Esoteric Programming Language that <i>looks</i> like Mathematics, but is actually closer to Literature and Chemistry...

### Carbogen

A Programming Language that makes use of scopes to do a bunch of interesting things, nowhere near finished lol

### VidSeq

A Language to aid with sequencing youtube videos, similar to coding a PowerPoint presentation, but with more control

### And a whole host of other things
